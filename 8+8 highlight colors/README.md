## FAQ

### Why don't use html ` <mark>`  for highlight ?
 Use ` <mark>`  need to hit many more times keyboard.

### Why use nested tag ? Why not lessly typing ?
 If don't use nested tag, although we only need to type color name: pink, navy, lime, the color tags list is too long ,and mixed with other nested tag , and it's not easy to manage color tags on the tag panel.
 
 If use nested tag, all color tags are placed under the same "h" parent tag. **"h" means highlight**.
 
 It's easy to search all pink color highlight contents in all pages, all blocks by just one click tag, and there are the highlight statistics on the tag panel.
 
### Why add WYSIWYG editor css for highlight colors ?
 If don't use WYSIWYS edior css , the color tag always display. We use that css for toggle it.
 
### If Obsidian have highlight toolbar in the future, Is this css snippet is necessary ï¼Ÿ
If Obisidan have highlight toolbar, select text, click color, **AND** allow search these highlight, This css snippet is not necessary any more.

If Obisidan have highlight toolbar, **Don't allow to search these highlight.** **This css snippet still works for easily search all highlight colors by just one click tag, and there are the highlight statistics on the tag panel.**
